# Project Exam Spring 2023
## Fun travel blog

## Description
This travel blog is only for educational purposes only. It is not to be used in any form of commercial usage.

This travel blog that i named Callie Furmint, is about a rabbit who's name is Callie Furmint, and the rabbit travels through
southern Eurp√•e with their owner that is to be unnamed.

# Development

The blog was designed in Figma, but for this one I steered away fro mthe original design during the development of the blog itself.
For the design I tried to draw inspiration from other travel blogs, but found most of them being too crowded with information, so I opted
for a light-weight design, that was easy to navigate around.
